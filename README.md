# ofxICP

Implementation of the iterative closest point algorithm (ICP) introduced by Besl and McKay 91.

## OS

I have tried it only in MacOS. 

## Features

Aligns 2 sets of points and computes rigid transformation between these 2 sets of points.

## Usage
For usage check examples.

It uses ofxOpenCv and ofxNearestNeighbour by Neil Mendoza (https://github.com/neilmendoza/ofxNearestNeighbour).
I haven't added ofxOpenCv in the libs, because it is part of OF, so if you want to use ofxICP add ofxOpenCv first.

You can use this code any way you like. I would be happy if you credited me for it though :)
